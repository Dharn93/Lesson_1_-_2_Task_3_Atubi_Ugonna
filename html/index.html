            <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <blockquote><p>A computer science can be said to be any machine thats capable of accepting , storing and processing data within a short period of time. A computer is built/based on three foundations which include <strong> OUTPUT, AND PROCESSING.</strong>
                A computer can be said to be a <strong> magic maker</strong> in the sense that it does works in seconds which ordinary takes humans hours to perform. There are several shapes, sizes, models and functions of a computer system which evolved\
                from the first generations of computer
            </p>
            <p>The computer system can also be classified into various groups and classes. these various divisions allows us to better understand and study the concepts of the computer system</p>

            <h2>Application Areas of Computer Science</h2>
            <h3>Brief review</h3>
            <p>The computer system can be applied or used in almost all areas of our lives. This is because we live in a digital world where every area snd aspects of life is being digitalised. 
                <em>Below are applicable areas of computer systm in our lives</em>
                <li>Research</li>
                <li>Hospitals</li>
                <li>Diffence and Warefare</li>
                <li>Aviation</li>
                <li>Supermarkets and grocery stores</li>

            <h2>Componenents of Computer System</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The components of the computer system simply refers to the various and individual hardware parts that collectively make up a computere system.
                Thes components allows the computer to carry out its tasks efficiently and with high accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>The following are various components of the computer system
                <li>Mouse</li>
                <li>keyboard</li>
                <li>Monitor</li>
                <li>CPU</li>
                <li>Hard disk</li>
            </p>

        <h2>Components Clasification</h2>
        <h3>Major Clasification</h3>
        <p>
            There are two major classification of the computer components. These are 
            <li>Software</li>
            <li>Hardware</li>

        <h2>
            Features of computer system
        </h2>
        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <p> A computer is highly efficient, and perform its task based on a set of instructions called Programmes. It doesnt make mistakes. 
            All mistakes are due to human error in writting the commands hence a computer can be said to be a <strong> <em> IN GARBAGE OUT</em></strong> machine' </p>

          <P>  Example typing the following code in your gitbash
             terminal gives you a wrong outcome differnt fome what u intended to computer to do for you.
            <code>git clone git.git@username.com.git</code> </P>

        <h3>Durability</h3>
    <p>Computer system is durable , and able to last long and withstand intensive use.</p>

            Uses of Computer
        </h2>
        <h3>Programming/Coding</h3>
        <p> A computer system can be used to write its own programming command or language. each specific line of code tells the computer what to do.<em>A pprogramme is a set of instruction given to the system to perform or carry out a given Task</em>
            Below are examples of line codes used in Git programming

            <pre>  
                
            </pre>
            <pre> git init<br> git status<br> git log<br> git add <br> git commit -m <br> git checkout branch<br>
            </pre>
          <P>  Example typing the following code in your gitbash terminal gives you a wrong outcome differnt fome what u intended to computer to do for you.</P>
            <code>git clone git.git@username.com.git</code>
